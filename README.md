## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, EJS, Passport.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Cloudinary, Multer 

Collaborating with a team of my colleagues we built this project over the course of about a week. I was wholly responsible for building the backend of this project with the rest of the team working on the frontend. Despite having no prior experience, I built the backend after spending a whole week before learning as much about backend development as I could. 

## Planned features

* A settings page to control such things as:
    * Dark mode
    * Blocked users
    * Reset password
    * Delete account
* View other people's pages
* Update the UI of the site
* Add ability to create an account with the site in addition to using a Microsoft or a Google account
* Add comments to posts
* Replace fetch requests with method overrides to reduce response times !

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt a lot about routing, using Express.js, configuring Microsoft Azure and MongoDB and using npm. I also learnt a lot about the MVC design pattern and how its used. I'm especially proud of learning how to send queries to the database and manipulating the data to dynamically generated the views layer.
I also learnt about collaborating in a team effectively and was able to gain real world experience for my knowledge in project management.
